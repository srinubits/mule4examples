Use - to get files which can cause OutOfMemory when we don't use transform message for testing with for each scope

	    generateXMLPayload("orders.xml", 2000000); -> orders_47MB.xml
		generateCSVPayload("orders.csv", 2000000); -> orders_33MB.csv

1. Reading from a Huge CSV file and want to process through for each scope:

   - we have to use "Transform Message" component (to convert the payload as Iterator) to stream the data and send to "for each" scope
   
2. Reading from a Huge CSV file and want to process through a batch scope
   
    - we don't need the dataweave, as data is going to be streamed and written to the disk before the batch job starts
    
3. Reading from a Huge XML file and want to process through for each scope:

     a. if we just use: source, logger and for each - then OutOfMemory Error
     b. if we use: source, logger, transform message, for each - then OutOfMemory Error
     c. if we use: source, logger, transform message as Iterator, for each - then ALSO OutOfMemory Error
     
     
     
Attributes are not available inside for each loop??
