Observations with On Table Row/Database listner:

1. You can have water mark on different items like id (integer), name(string)

2. As soon as the events are received to the flow, water mark data is updated

3. Even though there is an exception while processing an event water mark data is not going to be updated

4. Even if one of the event is taking more time, the next events will get delivered

5. If we set max concurrency to 1 like below we always get one event/one record delivered

<flow name="water-mark-db-testFlow1" doc:id="4d25ac90-ffef-4922-a266-002c650a068e" 
	initialState="${mysql.listnerInitialState}" maxConcurrency="1">
